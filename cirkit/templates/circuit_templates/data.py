    """Constructs a symbolic circuit whose structure is tailored for image data sets.

    Args:
        image_shape: The image shape (C, H, W), where C is the number of channels, H is the height
            of the images, and W is their width.
        region_graph: The name of the region graph to use. It can be one of the following:
            'quad-tree-2' (the Quad-Tree with two splits per region node),
            'quad-tree-4' (the Quad-Tree with four splits per region node),
            'quad-graph'  (the Quad-Graph region graph),
            'random-binary-tree' (the random binary tree on "flat" pixels),
            'poon-domingos' (the Poon-Domingos architecture).
        input_layer: The name of the input layer. It can be one of the following:
            'categorical' (encoding a Categorical distribution over pixel channel values),
            'binomial' (encoding a Binomial distribution over pixel channel values),
        num_input_units: The number of input units per input layer.
        sum_product_layer: The name of the sum-product inner layer. It can be one of the following:
            'cp' (the canonical decomposition layer, consisting of dense layers followed by a
            hadamard product layer), 'cpt' (the transposed canonical decomposition layer, consisting
            of a hadamard product layer followed by a single dense layer), 'tucker' (the Tucker
            decomposition layer, consisting of a kronecker product layer followed by a single dense
            layer).
        num_sum_units: The number of sum units in each sum layer, i.e., either dense or mixing
            layer.
        sum_weight_param: The method to use to parameterize the weights of sum layers. It can be
            one of the following: 'id' (identity, i.e., no parameterization), 'softmax',
            'positive-clamp' (equivalent to max(., 1e-18)).

    Returns:
        Circuit: A symbolic circuit.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If one of the arguments is not one of the specified allowed ones.
